      <h2>What is IQ?</h2>
      <p>IQ, or intelligence quotient, is a standardized metric used to quantify general cognitive ability, often referred to as "g." It is derived from a range of psychometric tests that assess various domains of mental functioning, including verbal comprehension, working memory, processing speed, and reasoning abilities.</p>
      <p>These tests are normed to produce a mean score of 100 with a standard deviation of 15, situating an individual's performance relative to their age-matched peers. Neuroscientific research has linked IQ to specific brain structures, with both genetic and environmental factors playing significant roles in cognitive development.</p>

      <p class="scale-explanation">Because IQ follows a bell-curve distribution, roughly 68 percent of people fall between 85 and 115. Scores around 130 and higher place an individual in the top two percent of the population, while scores below 70 indicate significant cognitive challenges.</p>

      <h2>Who Is This Service For?</h2>
      <p>Our DNA-based estimate is designed for people who already possess raw genotype data from 23andMe or AncestryDNA and want a research-grade, non-diagnostic indication of cognitive potential. Typical users include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Parents interested in early talent identification</li>
        <li>Educators seeking additional context for gifted-program placement</li>
        <li>Researchers exploring genetics and cognition</li>
        <li>Curious individuals who simply want to learn more about themselves</li>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What will my results look like?</h3>
        <p>Your report lists a single predicted Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), a 95 percent confidence interval, and a percentile rank. The point estimate represents the model's best guess given your genetic and environmental inputs. The confidence interval shows the range in which your true score would likely fall if you took a formal IQ test, and the percentile tells you what proportion of the population you are predicted to outperform.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How accurate is the prediction?</h3>
        <p>Our model explains approximately 9-11% of the variance in IQ scores, representing the current state of the science. While this is significant, it means many factors beyond what we measure also contribute to cognitive performance.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this a replacement for clinical IQ testing?</h3>
        <p>No. This is a research-grade estimation based on genomic data and should not be used for clinical diagnosis or decision-making. Professional IQ testing involves trained psychologists and comprehensive assessments.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What environmental factors do you consider?</h3>
        <p>We include parental education level as an environmental variable in our model, which serves as a proxy for several developmental factors that influence cognitive ability.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do you protect my privacy?</h3>
        <p>Your genetic data is encrypted during transmission and processing. We do not store your raw genetic data after analysis, and all results are de-identified and protected.</p>
