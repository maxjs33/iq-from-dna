        <h2>Understanding Genetics and Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Intelligence is what scientists call a "complex trait" – it's influenced by hundreds or even thousands of genes, each with a small effect, as well as environmental factors. Modern genetic research has made it possible to identify many of these genetic variants and estimate their combined influence.</p>
        
        <h3>The Basics: How Genes Influence Cognition</h3>
        <p>Genes provide instructions for building proteins that affect brain development, neural connectivity, neurotransmitter function, and other biological processes that ultimately influence cognitive abilities. Although no single "intelligence gene" exists, the combined effect of many genetic variants creates a meaningful signal that correlates with cognitive performance.</p>

      <div class="science-section">
        <h2>Our Methodology in Simple Terms</h2>
        
        <div class="methodology-step">
          <h3>Step 1: Genome-Wide Association Studies</h3>
          <p>Scientists have conducted large studies with hundreds of thousands of people, measuring both their IQ scores and their genetic makeup. These studies identify which genetic variants are more common in people with higher or lower cognitive abilities.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="methodology-step">
          <h3>Step 2: Creating a Polygenic Score</h3>
          <p>We use these research findings to create what's called a "polygenic score" – essentially adding up the small effects of thousands of genetic variants found in your DNA. This score represents the genetic component of your cognitive potential.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="methodology-step">
          <h3>Step 3: Incorporating Environmental Factors</h3>
          <p>We include parental education level as an environmental factor in our model. This helps account for some non-genetic influences on cognitive development, as parental education correlates with many aspects of the child's learning environment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="methodology-step">
          <h3>Step 4: Statistical Modeling</h3>
          <p>Our algorithms combine your genetic data with environmental information to produce an estimate of your Full-Scale IQ, along with a confidence interval that accounts for statistical uncertainty.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="science-section">
        <h2>Understanding the Limitations</h2>
        <p>Our current model explains approximately 9-11% of the variance in IQ scores. This is scientifically significant but means that most of the factors influencing your cognitive abilities are not captured in this estimate. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Environmental factors beyond parental education</li>
          <li>Gene-environment interactions</li>
          <li>Rare genetic variants not captured by standard genotyping</li>
          <li>Epigenetic effects (changes in how genes are expressed)</li>
          <li>Random developmental factors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is why we provide a confidence interval with each estimate, acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in this type of prediction.</p>
